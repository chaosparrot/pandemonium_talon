Pandemonium Talon ( Parrot scripts for Talon )
------

This is a bundling of some of my personal parrot scripts to use with Talon.
It is going to be very subject to change, but I imagine some of the scripts might be useful for people out there looking for inspiration.

If you want to play around with the Parrot integration for Talon, you will have to sign up for the Talon Voice Beta.

So why is this repository called pandemonium? Well just look at the definition:

Pandemonium definition
/ˌpandɪˈməʊnɪəm/
noun
	"wild and noisy disorder or confusion; uproar; a group of parrots"
	
This both perfectly describes it as a group of parrot scripts, and describes 90% of my mental state while working on it.


Features
=====

Noise modes - A set of modes next to the speech modes that can be switched to using a terminator noise ( palatal click in these scripts )

Power Momentum - Build up momentum using louder noises for longer time periods and use that momentum to do tasks like scrolling.

Currently only works with scrolling, but could also be used for other things

Kingfisher click - Turns on the eyetracker mouse for a brief second to place the cursor there, then turns off the tracking again, clicks and returns the mouse to the previous position

Woodpecker drill - Tapered repeater that performs an action more the longer a noise is made

Hummingbird - Arrowkeys, but with noises. Also allows the user to turn on continuous mode so the noise doesn't have to be made continuously.
Currently supports text navigation, selection, arrow keys and mouse movement
