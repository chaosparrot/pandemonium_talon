Pandemonium Talon ( Parrot scripts for Talon )
------

This is a bundling of some of my personal parrot scripts to use with Talon.
It is going to be very subject to change, but I imagine some of the scripts might be useful for people out there looking for inspiration.

If you want to play around with the Parrot integration for Talon, you will have to sign up for the Talon Voice Beta.

So why is this repository called pandemonium? Well just look at the definition:

Pandemonium definition
/ˌpandɪˈməʊnɪəm/
noun
	"wild and noisy disorder or confusion; uproar; a group of parrots"
	
This both perfectly describes it as a group of parrot scripts, and describes 90% of my mental state while working on it.
